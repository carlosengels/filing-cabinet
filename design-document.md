#### Authorization
- Define user roles (e.g., admin, standard user)
- Enforce permissions via API Gateway custom authorizers or IAM roles

### 5.2. API Layer

#### Endpoints
| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/upload` | Handles document uploads with mobile-optimized chunked upload support |
| `/documents/{id}` | Retrieves document details and download links with compression options |
| `/documents/{id}/tags` | Endpoints to add, remove, or list tags |
| `/search` | Query documents based on tags, names, or other metadata |
| `/sync` | Handles mobile device data synchronization |
| `/notifications` | Manages push notification preferences and delivery |

#### Mobile-Specific Features
