## 1. Overview

This document describes the design for an application that enables users to upload, manage, and categorize their documents with tags. The backend is built on AWS, taking advantage of managed services to ensure scalability, security, and high availability.

### Key Objectives

- **File Management**: Enable upload, download, deletion, and organization of documents
- **Tagging & Categorization**: Allow users to assign multiple tags to files for flexible categorization and searchability
- **Scalability**: Utilize AWS managed services to handle varying loads and ensure high availability
- **Security**: Ensure data protection both at rest and in transit, with strict access controls

## 2. Functional Requirements

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Secure user login and role-based access control to ensure only authorized actions are performed

### File Operations
- Upload documents (support for multiple file types such as PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Download and preview documents
- Delete or update document metadata

### Tagging and Categorization
- Create, edit, and delete tags
- Associate multiple tags with a document
- Search documents based on tags and metadata

### Search & Filtering
- Implement keyword search for document titles, descriptions, and tags
- Provide filtering options based on date, file type, or tag

### Audit Logging & Versioning
- Log file operations for audit purposes
- Maintain version history for documents when updates occur

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Performance | Fast response times for file retrieval and search operations |
| Scalability | Ability to scale horizontally using AWS services (e.g., auto-scaling groups, managed databases) |
| Security | Data encryption (in-transit and at-rest), secure API endpoints, and regular security audits |
| Maintainability | Modular architecture and well-documented code to ease future enhancements and debugging |
| Cost Efficiency | Leverage AWS managed services to reduce operational overhead and optimize costs |

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1. High-Level Architecture

The system architecture leverages several AWS services as follows:

#### Frontend
- Web or mobile client built using a modern framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js)
- Interacts with backend APIs

#### Backend API
- RESTful API hosted on AWS API Gateway
- Implemented using AWS Lambda (serverless functions) or containerized microservices via ECS/Fargate

#### File Storage
- Amazon S3 serves as the primary storage for uploaded documents
- Provides durability, scalability, and native integration with other AWS services

#### Metadata Storage & Tagging Data
- Amazon DynamoDB (NoSQL) or Amazon RDS (SQL)
- Stores document metadata, including file paths, tags, and user information

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Amazon Cognito for user identity management and secure API access

#### Search Functionality
- Amazon Elasticsearch Service (OpenSearch Service)
- Indexes document metadata and supports complex queries for tagging and search

#### Monitoring & Logging
- Amazon CloudWatch for logging, metrics, and alerting

## 5. Detailed Component Design

### 5.1. User Management

#### Authentication
- Utilize Amazon Cognito to handle user registration, sign-in, and password recovery

#### Authorization
- Define user roles (e.g., admin, standard user)
- Enforce permissions via API Gateway custom authorizers or IAM roles

### 5.2. API Layer

#### Endpoints
| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/upload` | Handles document uploads. Generates unique ID and stores in S3; metadata and tags saved in DynamoDB/RDS |
| `/documents/{id}` | Retrieves document details and download links |
| `/documents/{id}/tags` | Endpoints to add, remove, or list tags |
| `/search` | Query documents based on tags, names, or other metadata |

#### Implementation
- AWS Lambda functions (or containers) for each endpoint
- Lambda functions process file upload, update metadata, and interact with other services

### 5.3. File Storage (Amazon S3)

#### Bucket Configuration
- S3 bucket with appropriate policies ensuring only authenticated users can upload/download

#### Lifecycle Policies
- Configure policies for archiving or deleting old versions if required

#### Versioning
- Enable versioning to keep track of file changes

### 5.4. Metadata and Tagging Storage

#### Schema Design
- **Document Metadata**: Document ID, file name, upload timestamp, S3 URL, owner, etc.
- **Tag Association**: Maintain a list or mapping of tags for each document

#### Choice of Storage
- DynamoDB for flexibility and scalability with non-relational data
- RDS if relational queries and transactions are needed

### 5.5. Search and Indexing

#### Indexing
- Configure AWS OpenSearch to index metadata fields and tags

#### Query Support
- Implement search queries that can filter by multiple tags, file names, and metadata

### 5.6. Security

#### Data Encryption
- **S3**: Enable server-side encryption (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)
- **API**: Use TLS for all data in transit

#### Access Controls
- Fine-grained IAM policies to restrict access to S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, and API Gateway endpoints

#### Audit & Logging
- Use CloudWatch for centralized logging of API requests, Lambda executions, and S3 access logs

## 6. AWS Deployment & Infrastructure

### 6.1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform to provision and manage AWS resources

### 6.2. CI/CD Pipeline

#### Build & Test
- Use CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to automate testing and deployment

#### Deployment
- Automate deployment for Lambda functions, API Gateway configurations, and container services

### 6.3. Monitoring & Alerts

#### Metrics
- Monitor API performance, Lambda invocations, error rates, and S3 metrics using CloudWatch

#### Alerts
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms for critical issues (e.g., API errors, unauthorized access attempts)

## 7. Scalability and Performance Considerations

### Auto Scaling
- Use AWS Lambda's inherent scaling capabilities
- Configure auto-scaling for ECS containers

### Caching
- Implement caching layers (e.g., Amazon ElastiCache) for frequently accessed metadata or search queries

### Database Scaling
- Choose DynamoDB's on-demand capacity mode
- Scale RDS vertically/horizontally based on usage

## 8. Future Enhancements

### Advanced Search Capabilities
- Incorporate full-text search, fuzzy matching, and relevance scoring

### Machine Learning
- Integrate AWS Rekognition or Comprehend for document analysis
- Enhance metadata extraction through OCR and sentiment analysis

### Mobile Application
- Develop native mobile apps for enhanced document management on-the-go

## 9. Conclusion

This design document outlines the essential components and considerations for building a scalable, secure, and efficient document management application on AWS. By leveraging AWS managed services like S3, Lambda, Cognito, and OpenSearch, the application can focus on delivering robust functionality while minimizing operational overhead. This modular and cloud-native approach ensures that the system is both flexible and resilient, capable of adapting to future requirements and scaling with user demand.
